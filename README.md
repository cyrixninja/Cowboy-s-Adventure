## What it does?

Our web app consists of three pages-
1. Chat - On this, you can chat and connect with other like-minded cowboys. You can tell the wildest of your Stories to fellow cowboys and have a great time.

## How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è
We built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.We used scaledrone's API for our chat service and GoDaddy Domain for hosting our website.


## Challenges we ran into üíª
The theme was very difficult and it was very difficult to decide what to make as we didn't know much about the wild west and cowboy culture. But we still finished the project somehow 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ
That we completed the project on time despite of not knowing much about wild west and cowboy ü§† culture and wild west.


## What we learned üìö
We learned about how to host websites using GoDaddy and GitHub pages. It was very easy to host websites using GoDaddy and GitHub Pages. We also learned about how to make animation in javascript and integrate it all in a single website.
